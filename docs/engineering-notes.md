# Engineering notes

Things we learned building the base stack that are not obvious from the upstream docs. Newest
first.

## 2026-10-11 — Base image (Postgres 18.6 + Citus 14.2 + DocumentDB 0.117 + pg_search 0.26.1 + pgvector 0.8.7 + pg_trickle 0.108.3)

`scripts/smoke.sh` passes on a single-node stack (coordinator holds shards), and passes on a
re-run. It covers:

- Citus distributes a table (32 shards).
- pgvector nearest-neighbour search works on the distributed table.
- pg_search BM25 works on the distributed table.
- A pg_trickle `IMMEDIATE` stream table updates in the same transaction as the insert.
- The DocumentDB gateway accepts a `mongosh` insert and read over TLS with SCRAM auth.

What we found along the way:

- **The DocumentDB gateway only supports password-less connections to Postgres.** It rejects
  `PGPASSWORD` and passwords in its config on purpose (`setup.rs`, "Track 1"). A `PostgresHostName`
  that starts with `/` is treated as a Unix-socket directory, so we run the gateway with Postgres's
  socket directory shared through a volume. Its defaults for `PostgresSystemUser` and
  `PostgresDataUser` are the OS user (`root` in a container), so we set both to `postgres`. For the
  managed cloud this means the gateway must sit next to Postgres (same pod), or we add password or
  certificate auth to it.
- **pg_trickle can't drop a stream table whose source table was dropped first.**
  `drop_stream_table` fails with "SpiTupleTable positioned before the start or after the end" once
  the stream table is suspended (`SOURCE_DROPPED` / `SOURCE_RECREATED`). Dropping in the normal
  order (stream table, then source) works. IsomerDB's projection lifecycle must drop the projection
  before the source table, or intercept `DROP TABLE` and do it in that order. Worth reporting
  upstream.
- **Citus warns about pg_trickle's validation views.** Creating a stream table logs `view
  __pgt_validate_output_* has dependency on unsupported object "schema pg_temp_*" … will be created
  only locally`. pg_trickle builds a temp view to validate the query, and Citus declines to
  propagate it. It's harmless, but it is the first sign of the Citus × pg_trickle interaction the
  PRD flags. Stream tables over **distributed** tables are still untested.
- **pg_search 0.26 deprecated `key_field`.** `WITH (key_field = …)` is now a no-op that warns; the PRD §15.2 example has been updated to drop it.
- **"isomer.conf contains errors" at first boot is harmless.** The image's entrypoint runs a
  temporary server during `initdb`, and `listen_addresses` can't change on reload. The real server
  starts cleanly afterwards.
- **No `rum` package exists for PG 18.** DocumentDB uses its own `pg_documentdb_extended_rum`, set by
  `documentdb.rum_library_load_option` and `documentdb.alternate_index_handler_name`.
- **DocumentDB version choice.** We vendored the latest stable, v0.117-0. v1.0-RC2 was published
  on 9 Oct 2026. Re-vendor before we start modifying the gateway, so our changes sit on 1.0.
- **Disk.** A cold build needs roughly 10–15 GB of Docker space (Rust toolchains plus three
  compiles). The first attempt failed because the Mac's disk was full, which left Docker's VM
  read-only until Docker Desktop was force-restarted.
